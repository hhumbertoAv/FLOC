# FLOC: Energy Monitoring Tool for Linux

## Description
FLOC is a comprehensive and highly versatile tool designed to measure applications' energy consumption in GNU/Linux environments. The main philosophy of FLOC is to allow users and developers to implement energy measurement in a single tool for as many software components as they want, using existing libraries such as RAPL[^1] or power equations. This first version focuses on four key components: CPU, RAM, hard drives, and network cards.

## Features
For each component, FLOC calculates the energy consumption based on the load generated by running processes identified by their PID. It uses load and energy consumption data provided by the GNU/Linux kernel interfaces or, in their absence, from a database of technical specifications (datasheets) which can be either predefined or customized. 

### Mathematical Formulas and Customization
FLOC includes a set of pre-defined mathematical formulas tailored for the four devices. These formulas have been proven to reflect the proportion of energy consumption by a process in relation to the total computer usage. Users and developers have the flexibility to define and maintain their own formulas, making FLOC a highly adaptable tool for various usage scenarios.

## Limitations
It is important to note that, as with any software tool that measures hardware energy consumption, there is a margin of variability. The values provided by FLOC are approximations and should not be considered absolutely precise.
